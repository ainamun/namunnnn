<p>On 2005, I started school when I was 5 years old. This school is near with my house. It took around 5 minutes and I went there by</p>
<p>bus with my friends. So, on the first day of school, I was excited and happy. But, in the next day, I started to cry every single day</p>
<p>because I did not want go to school. Even though I always crying, I think it is one of beautiful memory to be remembered.</p>
<p>In this school, I have been taught a lot of things such as reading, writing, how to pray, fasting and many more.</p>

<br>
<p>For primary school, I went to Sekolah Kebangsaan Jalan 6 on 2007 until 2012. It was located at Bandar Baru Bangi. I went there with my</p>
<p>mom every day because she was a teacher at the same school. Back then, I was a school prefect. On year 2012, I took the UPSR exam and I got</p>
<p>3A 2B for UPSR.</p>

<p>After finishing primary school, I got an offered from Sekolah Agama Menengah Sungai Merab Luar, Kajang on. So, I started went to secondary</p>
<p>school on 2013. During my time in secondary school I had really good moments, but my best moments that I've experienced are during my senior year.<p>
<p>It is because me and my friends are study hard for SPM. Through this, it makes our relationship stronger as we help each other when we are study.</p>
<p>As a result, I got 5A 3B+ for SPM.<p>

<br>
<p>I managed to continue my studies at UiTM Kedah. I first became a student at UiTM Kedah when I was 18 years old (2018), studying in majors of library</p>
<p>management. It was my first time to be apart with my family This was one of the best things I have ever done, meeting new friends, making memories,</p>
<p> and I also learn how to live independently without my family and many more.</p>
<br>
<p>I chose the majors in library management because I want to learn something new and to gain some knowledge. I enjoy the course, as it is very interesting</p>
<p>learning. All of these are subjects I have never studied before, and the course is very good at keeping everyone on the same page. We are all taught the</p>
<p>basics, so we are all at the same level of understanding. The course is quite challenging, and it can be very difficult at times, but Alhamdulillah, so far</p>
<p>I can handle the pressure and get a good results for final exam.</p>
