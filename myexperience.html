<p>During the last semester break, I as a student of library management has an industrial training in the library for 6 weeks.</p>
<p> So, I chose Library of Tun Seri Lanang that was located in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) for my internship place.</p>
<p>I went there with my friends which is Amirah Zakiah and Anis Aida.</p>
<br>
<p>For 6 weeks working in that library, I have been learned and taught a lot of things. Through this industrial learning, it helps</p>
<p>me to improve my knowledge and help me to improve in subject cataloguing. Besides, it give me a good memories because the librarians</p>
<p>and the staff are very nice to me.</p>
<br>
<p>The things that I have been taught such as how to catalogue books, how to put the book on the shelves using call number. Besides, I am</p>
<p>also being taught how to input data into library system and many more. I think this will help me when I start working soon. This is</p>
<p> one of the best experienced that I ever had in my life.</p>
